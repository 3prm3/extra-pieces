Piece Packs are JSON files that tell Extra Pieces to add blocks.
This folder will contain ones made by me (Shnupbups, the author of Extra Pieces) as a sort of... 'official' repository of them.

To install them, put them in the piece packs folder.
The piece packs folder can be found inside the Extra Pieces folder inside the config directory of your Minecraft instance.

For any modders who would like to ship their mods with a built in piece pack, you can!
Instructions can be found on the wiki at https://github.com/Shnupbups/extra-pieces/wiki/Mod-Compatibility

A list of the piece packs in this folder is as follows: (may not always be kept up to date)

- Default (ships with the mod, you don't need to install this) - default.json
- Old (piece sets that used to be in the default pack before version 2.2.0) - old.json
- Odds and Ends (vanilla sets that aren't in the default or old packs) - odds.json
- Terrestria (ships with Terrestria, you don't need to install this) - terrestria.json
- Traverse (for the mod Traverse) - traverse.json
- EzWastelands (for the mod EzWastelands) - wastelands.json

Planned future packs:

- Blockus (for the mod Blockus)
- FabriBlocks (for the mod FabriBlocks)
- Nether Things (for the mod Nether Things)
- Cotton Resources (for the mod Cotton Resources)
- Engination (for the mod Engination)
